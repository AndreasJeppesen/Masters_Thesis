# Masters_Thesis
Masters Thesis on applying diffusion models to data from Continuous Performance Tests. Code for data simulation, Stan models, fitting the models, and visualizing results.

Files with suffix _sim_f contain functions for simulating task-specific data.

Files with suffix _tmux are named so, as they have been run using tmux on external CPUs. These files contain lengthy model fits.

Some Rmds also contain the code for heavy model fits. They will, however, also have code reading data files with the samples from the model fits run on external CPUs.
